#C LICENCE

*C*ommunity & *C*harity driven licence.

- The A Licence is where you put your money to make more money.
- The B licence is when you get manipulated by society into buying shit your don’t need.
- The C licence is when you know you’re contributing to society.

This licence can only be used in the following scenario.

- It can only raise money for another C - licence operator
- No money can be made or charged except when using the c-licence network and donation support.


***A scenario:***

A charity organization called *ABC* provides a service that is 
funded trough private (or public) donation. 
 Charity ABC operates it’s services trough the C-Licence.

It means it cannot raises money to auto fund itself, instead it can only raises money to fund a separate C-Licence operated community service.
