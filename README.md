#C LICENCE

**C**ommunity & **C**harity driven licence.

- The A Licence is where you put your money to make more money.
- The B licence is when you get manipulated by A licence holders into buying shit your don’t need.
- The C licence is when you know you’re contributing to society for good - and don't get ripped off.

This licence can only be used in the following combined scenario.

- It can only raise money for a C - licence operator.
- No money can be made or charged except when using the c-licence network and donation support.

***A scenario:***

A charity organization called *ABC* provides a service that is 
funded trough private (or public) donation. 
 Charity ABC operates it’s services trough the C-Licence.

It means it cannot raises money to auto fund itself, instead it can only raises money to fund a separate C-Licence operated community service.


**How to prevent licence hacks?**

Charity *A* is generating much more donation than Charity *B*, and *A* needs much more funding than charity *B* to achieve its goal.

However, for some circumstances (they can be marketing, or opinion based), *B* gather most of the funding choices.

As a result, *A* might struggle to operate correctly, although their marketing and convertion rate drives most of the C-Licence community.

A system, or formula is needed to ensures that *B* **never** gets too much, and *A* **never** gets too little.
